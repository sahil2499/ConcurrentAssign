I have the following files 
Vacuum.java : Contains the code 
Robot.txt 
RoomFile.txt 
Linux.sh for shell script to run linux file 
windows.bat for running in linux 
Make sure you download these and files and keep them in same folder since java file takes input from the other txt files . I have used vscode . Kindly run the java file . 

Run the shell file in the terminal based on your system .
